AuthSphere: ðŸš€ Authentication & Authorization API

Welcome to AuthSphere! This backend application offers a comprehensive solution for managing user authentication and authorization using modern technologies like FastAPI, JWT tokens, and MariaDB.

Designed with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), AuthSphere is perfect for small to medium-scale applications that require secure login, role-specific permissions, and efficient token management. This project is continuously evolving, with future enhancements planned, including caching to further optimize performance.
